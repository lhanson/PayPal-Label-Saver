Purpose
=======
Do you print a lot of PayPal shipping labels, but get frustrated wasting half a
page of label paper because the generated label is half instructions and other
info? This handy project will automatically generate a printable document which
only contains the mailing label portion.

Prerequisite: you need the GIMP installed (http://www.gimp.org/)


Installation instructions
=========================

OS X
====
On OS X we hook into the PDF Services available in the print dialog to
provide a menu option which automatically crops the PDF from PayPal and
sends it to your selected printer.

- Copy script-fu-process-shipping-label.scm into ~/.gimp-2.x/scripts
- Copy the "Print as PayPal Shipping Label" script into
  ~/Library/PDF Services/ and edit the variables at the top of the newly-copied
  script to match your environment.
- Now when you print a PayPal-generated shipping label and the OS X print
  dialog is shown, select your printer, then click the PDF dropdown button and
  choose "Print as PayPal Shipping Label".

Other Unix-like systems
=======================
- Copy script-fu-process-shipping-label.scm to ~/.gimp-2.x/scripts
- Copy printPayPalLabel.sh to somewhere on your $PATH (optional) and edit the
  variables at the top of the script to match your environment.
- To process the PayPal label, execute printPayPalLabel.sh with the filename
  as input. Assumes the existence of the 'lpr' command and prints to the
  default printer.

Windows
=======
- Copy script-fu-process-shipping-label.scm and processPayPalLabel.bat into 
  your GIMP installation's scripts directory.
- Edit processPayPalLabel.bat to set the correct path to your GIMP executable.
- Edit the last line of processPayPalLabel.reg to point to the batch file from
  the previous step.
- Make a backup of the Windows registry, since you're about to alter it and I
  won't have you blaming me for any Windows problems.
- Double-click the processPayPalLabel.reg file to merge the entries into the
  registry. This will give you a menu item called "Process as PayPal Shipping
  Label" when you right-click a file. Selecting this menu item will create
  a .png file of the printable label in the same directory.
